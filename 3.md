  - Self-Attention Mechanism (1 hour): Explain how self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when predicting the next word. Discuss how it helps in capturing dependencies regardless of their distance in the input sequence.
  - Multi-Head Attention (1 hour): Elaborate on why using multiple attention heads helps the model learn to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. Provide examples to illustrate how multi-head attention enhances the model's ability to learn complex relationships within the data.

Encoder and Decoder Stacks in the Transformer (2 hours):
- Understanding the encoder and decoder stacks is essential for comprehending how information flows through a Transformer model during training and inference.

  - Decoder Stack (1 hour): Discuss how the decoder stack generates the output sequence based on the encoded representation of the input sequence. Emphasize the importance of attention mechanisms in aligning input and output sequences during translation tasks.

Day 2:

Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks (1 hour):
- Dive into the details of position-wise feed-forward networks, which are responsible for adding non-linearity to the Transformer model by applying fully connected layers to each position independently.

Positional Encoding in Transformer Models (2 hours):
- Positional encoding is crucial for providing Transformer models with information about the position of tokens in the input sequence.
  - Sinusoidal Encoding (1 hour): Explain how sinusoidal positional encoding introduces sinusoidal functions to represent the position of tokens in a sequence. Discuss the advantages and limitations of this encoding method.
  - Learned Positional Embeddings (1 hour): Describe how learned positional embeddings offer a flexible way to capture positional information by allowing the model to learn the positional encodings during training.
